# If you have autohotkey, or are willing to install autohotkey in order to avoid executable files, use the folder "AHK Version."

# If you haven't the time and want the self contained version, use the compiled version.


# If you need more profiles, duplicate any of the .ini files, and rename it. You can also do this in the Load section of the settings. You can name your settings files anything you wish, as long as they end in ".ini".



## Basic commands:

~ Right clicking the icon in the system tray will provide certain options.

~ Ctrl+Sh+Esc (While DS3 is focused) opens control customizations window.

~ Ctrl+Esc (While DS3 is focused) reloads the hotkey app. Useful if something is glitched.
